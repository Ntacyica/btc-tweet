Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), is an alternative class of digital assets primarily used as a medium of exchange. In the financial market, data collected from social media such as tweets, posts, and can assist in an early indication of market sentiment. This has frequently been conducted on Twitter data. In particular, this paper provides a corpus of tweet text for Bitcoin-related tweets during the summer of the COVID-19 era. This dataset is publicly available covering a considerable period of roughly three months, to allow people with a similar interest in Twitter, Bitcoin, sentiment analysis, and the financial sector to perform research unimpeded. © 2020 IEEE.","Bitcoin; Covid-19; Sentiment Analysis; Tweets","","Stenqvist, E., Lonno, J., (2017) Predicting Bitcoin Price Fluctuation with Twitter Sentiment Analysis, , Dissertation,.

Nevertheless, the users of machine learning usually find that these sophisticated techniques could incur a high level of tensions caused by the selection of the appropriate size of the training data set among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic way of resolving such tensions by examining practical examples of predicting popularity and sentiment of posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs on Mashable, news on Google and Yahoo, the US house survey, and Bitcoin prices. Interesting results show that for the case of big data, using around 20% of the full sample often leads to a better prediction accuracy than opting for the full sample. Our conclusion is found to be consistent across a series of experiments. The managerial implication is that using more is not necessarily the best and users need to be cautious about such an important sensitivity as the simplistic approach may easily lead to inferior solutions with potentially detrimental consequences. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Data size; Machine learning; Prediction accuracy; Social media",,"Abdollahi, M., Khaleghi, T., Yang, K., An integrated feature learning approach using deep learning for travel time prediction (2020) Expert Syst.

Like sentiment analysis, Bitcoin which is a digital cryptocurrency also attracts the researchers considerably in the domain of cryptography, computer science, and economics. The objective of this work is to forecast the direction of Bitcoin price by analyzing user opinions in social media such as Twitter. To our knowledge, this is the very first attempt which estimates the direction of Bitcoin price fluctuations by using word embedding models in addition to deep learning techniques in the state-of-the-art studies. For the purpose of estimating the direction of Bitcoin, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as deep learning architectures and Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText are employed as word embedding models in the experiments. In order to demonstrate the contribution of our work, experiments are carried out on English Twitter dataset. Experiment results show that the usage of FastText model as a word embedding model outperforms other models with 89.13% accuracy value to estimate the direction of Bitcoin price. © 2020, Ismail Saritas.

Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models",,"Abraham, J., Higdon, D., Nelson, J., Ibarra, J., Cryptocurrency price prediction using tweet volumes and sentiment analysis (2018) SMU Data Science Review, 1 (3), p. 1; Alessandretti, L., ElBahrawy, A., Aiello, L.M., Baronchelli, A., (2018) Machine learning the cryptocurrency market, , SSRN 3183792; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X.-J., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2, pp. 1-8. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Bottou, L., Large-scale machine learning with stochastic gradient descent (2010) Proceedings of COMPSTAT'2010, pp. 177-186. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-7908-2604-3_16, Y.

In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1–14% of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter “bot” accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bots; Cryptocurrencies; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis; Twitter",,"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is All That Talk Just Noise?

Much less work has been carried out into examining whether a technology adoption has impact on corporate reputation. This paper aims to examine the latter topic in a context where social media is the channel used to share news about the introduction of a new technology. The empirical setting of the study consists of five retail companies located in the USA that decided to include Bitcoin as a payment platform. Design/methodology/approach: Twitter data were used to measure how sharing news about the adoption of new technology could affect the reputation of the companies selected, keeping a clear distinction between the volume of data relating to social media responses and the sentiment expressed in the tweets. A panel vector autoregression model was used to incorporate series of data relating to news items, volume and sentiment. Findings: The results show that the news about the adoption of a new technology has a positive impact on both the volume of tech-related tweets and the sentiment expressed in the tweets themselves, although the patterns of these two effects are different. The resulting impact decreases after a few days, both in volume and in sentiment. Research limitations/implications: The analysis has limitations that future research could address by extending and diversifying the examined companies and the social media used as data sources. The research suggests that managers in medium-sized companies can leverage on the introduction of new technologies that have a direct impact on their customers and gain reputational benefits in terms of immediate visibility. Originality/value: The research introduces an additional dimension of analysis to the current stream of corporate reputation. Although the literature has already covered the dynamics of response to events on Twitter, by focusing on the adoption of the new Bitcoin technology, the paper provides novel insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Corporate reputation; Sentiment analysis; Social media analysis; Technology adoption; Vector autoregression",,"Agarwal, J., Stackhouse, M., Osiyevskyy, O., I love that company: look how ethical, prominent, and efficacious it is – a Triadic Organizational Reputation (TOR) scale (2018) Journal of Business Ethics, 153 (3), pp. 889-910; Ageeva, E., Melewar, T.C., Foroudi, P., Dennis, C., Jin, Z., Examining the influence of corporate website favorability on corporate image and corporate reputation: findings from fsQCA (2018) Journal of Business Research, 89, pp. 287-304; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: a longitudinal study (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 197-220; Ayers, D.J., Menachemi, N., Ramamonjiarivelo, Z., Matthews, M., Brooks, R.G., Adoption of electronic medical records: the role of network effects (2009) Journal of Product & Brand Management, 18 (2), pp. 127-135; Bachmann, R., Elstner, S., Sims, E.R., (2010) Uncertainty and economic activity, , www.nber.org/papers/w16143, NBER Working Paper 16143, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA; Barnett, M.L., Jermier, J.M., Lafferty, B.A., Corporate reputation: the definitional landscape (2006) Corporate Reputation Review, 9 (1), pp. 26-38; Barnett, M.L., Pollock, T.G., (2012) The Oxford Handbook of Corporate Reputation, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Basdeo, D.K., Smith, K.G., Grimm, C.M., Rindova, V.P., Derfus, P.J., The impact of market actions on firm reputation (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27 (12), pp. 1205-1219; Benjamin, B.A., Podolny, J.M., Status, quality, and social order in the California wine industry (1999) Administrative Science Quarterly, 44 (3), pp. 563-589; Bhuta, S., Doshi, A., Doshi, U., Narvekar, M., A review of techniques for sentiment analysis of twitter data (2014) 2014 International Conference on Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), pp. 583-591. , IEEE; Biswas, D., Biswas, A., The diagnostic role of signals in the context of perceived risks in online shopping do signals matter more on the web?

Because of its digital nature, Bitcoin cannot be valuated exclusively with fundamental approaches, which is why factors such as investor sentiment have become a common alternative to capture its performance. In this work, we studied whether and how the sale of Bitcoins from the insolvency assets of Mt.Gox, which represent about 1.1% of the current global total, relates to Bitcoin price movements. We used social media sentiment analysis of Twitter data to examine how investors are influenced in their decision to buy or sell Bitcoin when confronted with the trade actions of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee in charge of the Mt.Gox case. We built a vector error correction model to analyse the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables. Our analysis confirms the positive association of Bitcoin performance with positive Twitter sentiment and tweet volume and the negative association with negative sentiment. We further found empirical evidence that Mt.Gox selloff events have a lasting negative impact on the Bitcoin price and that we can measure this effect by Twitter sentiment and tweet volume. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

This is particularly true for tourism, which is undergoing significant changes due to the development of new technologies. The level of technology diffusion depends on several factors like the exchange of information among peers, and the attitude and shared perception among the contributors. The aim of the study is to explore the diffusion of technology in tourism with a specific focus on the social media discourse around new technologies. Thus, the paper investigates the level of interest in these new technologies analysing the information exchange occurring between individuals on Twitter in order to explore the influence of reciprocal networking. Design/methodology/approach: To capture the attitudes expressed in the industry, the study analyses the ongoing discourse on Twitter as a proxy for the participants “interest in new technologies. Through a social network analysis of the tweets and retweets conducted over a period of nine months, the research maps the level of information exchange about the diffusion of new technologies. Moreover, the sentiment analysis provides an interesting overview of the individuals” attitudes towards the awareness or the adoption of new technologies. Findings: Our analysis has provided several insights: (1) the information network on blockchain in tourism consists of participants who change very quickly over time (high turnover of accounts); (2) some contributors have an extremely important role in influencing the flow of information in the system (information centralization), they can have a generalist (discussing several topics) or a specialist (focusing on a specific topic) behaviour and this strategic choice influences their network's structure; (3) these central nodes also have an impact on the definition of positive and negative sentiment towards a topic (sentiment influencer). Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to the literature on technology diffusion, by focusing on one of the preconditions of diffusion that is the shared positive attitude towards technological innovation. More specifically, we adopt a network-based approach, which is useful to explain the level of information exchange and the public discourse that can impact the shared perception and attitude towards technological innovation. The study also highlights the role of knowledge brokers in influencing this public discourse. Future studies can deepen the association between positive perception, higher levels of information exchange and increasing usage of specific technologies. Our results also suggest further exploring the opportunity to combine social media data and other sources of information to shed more light on the technological innovation diffusion processes. Practical implications: This paper shows how practitioners can benefit from the analysis of information exchange about new technologies in tourism adopting a network perspective with the aim of understanding the level of influence among contributors. Moreover, the increasing interest in blockchain technology and the potential combination between social media data and other sources of information can offer promising insights. Social implications: The present study explores the level of technology diffusion through the analysis of information exchange on social media (Twitter). Furthermore, the dynamics of individual user behaviour offers a better understanding about media effects. Originality/value: While previous research is focused on the users' perception towards the development of new technologies in tourism, the aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics behind the level of diffusion of information and awareness about these new technologies, which still represents an unexplored area of research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Perception; Social media; Social network analysis; Technology adoption; Technology diffusion; Tourism",,"Aggarwal, C.C., An introduction to social network data analytics (2011) Social Network Data Analytics, pp. 1-15. , Springer, Boston, MA; Araujo, T., Neijens, P., Vliegenthart, R., Getting the word out on twitter: the role of influentials, information brokers and strong ties in building word-of-mouth for brands (2017) International Journal of Advertising, 36 (3), pp. 496-513; Arenas, A., Goh, J., Urueña, A., How does IT affect design centricity approaches: evidence from Spain's smart tourism ecosystem (2019) International Journal of Information Management, 45, pp. 149-162; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by historical events (1989) The Economic Journal, 99 (394), pp. 116-131; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., (2010), pp. 492-499. , Predicting the future with social media, IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on web intelligence and intelligent agent technology, Toronto, ON; Bae, Y., Lee, H., Sentiment analysis of twitter audiences: measuring the positive or negative influence of popular twitterers (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (12), pp. 2521-2535; Bandura, A., The explanatory and predictive scope of self-efficacy theory (1986) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 4 (3), pp. 359-373; Bass, F.M., A new product growth for model consumer durables (1969) Management Science, 15 (5), pp. 215-227; Bian, J., Yoshigoe, K., Hicks, A., Yuan, J., He, Z., Xie, M., Guo, Y., Modave, F., Mining twitter to assess the public perception of the ‘internet of things' (2016) PloS One, 11, p. 7; Bolici, F., Giustiniano, L., Design science and eTrust: designing organizational artifacts as nexus of social and technical interactions (2013) Organizational Change and Information Systems, pp. 177-190. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Bonchi, F., Castillo, C., Gionis, A., Jaimes, A., Social network analysis and mining for business applications (2011) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, p. 3; Boucher, P., Nascimento, S., Kritikos, M., How blockchain technology could change our lives (2017) European Parliamentary Research Service, Scientific Foresight Unit, pp. 1-28. , European Parliament, Brussels; Buhalis, D., Strategic use of information technologies in the tourism industry (1998) Tourism Management, 19 (5), pp. 409-421; Buhalis, D., Law, R., Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet—the state of eTourism research (2008) Tourism Management, 29 (4), pp. 609-623; Buhalis, D., O'Connor, P., Information communication technology revolutionizing tourism (2005) Tourism Recreation Research, 30 (3), pp. 7-16; Buhalis, D., Sinarta, Y., Real-time co-creation and nowness service: lessons from tourism and hospitality (2019) Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 36 (5), pp. 563-582; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigns Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research ReferenceEntrepreneurship, Harvard Univ.

We also evaluate the quality of automated sentiment classification in comparison to manually assigned sentiment labeling. The results show that the manual approach gives significantly better results in some datasets, and superior performance of MLP, WiSARD and decision tree methods.

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety. © 2019 IEEE.","cryptocurrency; machine learning; price prediction; real time; sentiment analysis; social media; software platform; Spark",,"Cryptocurrency-what Is A Cryptocurrency ?, , https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp; Cryptolization-cryptocurrency Market Cap Analysis, , https://cryptolization.com; Lamon, C., Nielsen, E., Redondo, E., Cryptocurrency price prediction using news and social media sentiment (2017) SMU Data Sci.

Consequently, it would be attractive for designers and policy-makers in this area to make out what social media users think about them on Twitter. The purpose of this study is to investigate the social opinions about different kinds of crypto-currencies and tune the best-customized classification technique to categorize the tweets based on sentiments. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilized a lexicon-based approach for analyzing the reviews on a wide range of crypto-currencies over Twitter data to measure positive, negative or neutral sentiments; in addition, the end result of sentiments played a training role to train a supervised technique, which can predict the sentiment loading of tweets about the main crypto-currencies. Findings: The findings further prove that more than 50 per cent of people have positive beliefs about crypto-currencies. Furthermore, this paper confirms that marketers can predict the sentiment of tweets about these crypto-currencies with high accuracy if they use appropriate classification techniques like support vector machine (SVM). Practical implications: Considering the growing interest in crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, Litcoin and Ripple), the findings of this paper have a remarkable value for enterprises in the financial area to obtain the promised benefits of social media analysis at work. In addition, this paper helps crypto-currencies vendors analyze public opinion in social media platforms. In this sense, the current paper strengthens our understanding of what happens in social media for crypto-currencies. Originality/value: For managers and decision-makers, this paper suggests that the news and campaign for their crypto in Twitter would affect people’s perspectives in a good manner. Because of this fact, the firms, investing in these crypto-currencies, could apply the social media as a magnifier for their promotional activities. The findings steer the market managers to see social media as a predictor tool, which can analyze the market through understanding the opinions of users of Twitter. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Crypto-currencies; Sentiment analysis; Twitter",,"Ahmed, S., Jaidka, K., Cho, J., The 2014 Indian elections on twitter: a comparison of campaign strategies of political parties (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (4), pp. 1071-1087; Angel, J.J., McCabe, D., The ethics of payments: paper, plastic, or Bitcoin?

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models. © 2019 by the authors.","Cryptocurrencies; Machine learning; Price movement; Sentiment analysis",,"Ferreira, M., Rodrigues, S., Reis, C.I., Maximiano, M., Blockchain: A Tale of Two Applications (2018) Appl.

Amongst them, we focus on the question of how is the price of digital currencies affected, which is a natural question especially when considering the price roller-coaster we witnessed for bitcoin in 2017-2018. We work under the hypothesis that price is affected by the web footprint of influential people, we refer to them as crypto-influencers. In this paper we provide neural models for predicting bitcoin price. We compare what happens when the model is fed only with recent price history versus what happens when fed, in addition, with a measure of the positivity or negativity of the sayings of these influencers, measured through a sentiment analysis of their twitter posts. We show preliminary evidence that twitter data should indeed help to predict the price of bitcoin, even though the measures we use in this paper have a lot of room for refinement. In particular, we also discuss the challenges of measuring the correct sensation of these posts, and discuss the work that should help improving our discoveries even further. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","Bitcoin; Price Prediction; Recurrent Neural Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter",,"Zhang, X.Z.Y., Wang, S., Yao, Y., Fanga, B., Yu, P.S., (2018) Improving Stock Market Prediction Via Heterogeneous Information Fusion; Zhang, X., Li, Y., Wang, S., Fang, B., Yu, P.S., (2018) Enhancing Stock Market Prediction with Extended Coupled Hidden Markov Model over Multi-Sourced Data; Li, T., Jing, B., Ying, N., Yu, X., (2017) Adaptive Scaling; Zhou, X., Pan, Z., Hu, G., Tang, S., Zhao, C., (2018) Stock Market Prediction on High-Frequency Data Using Generative Adversarial Nets; Bandara, K., Shi, P., Bergmeir, C., Hewamalage, H., Tran, Q., Seaman, B., (2019) Sales Demand Forecast in E-Commerce Using a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Methodology; Karevan, Z., Suykens, J.A.K., (2018) Spatio-Temporal Stacked LSTM for Temperature Prediction in Weather Forecasting; Girkar, U.M., Uchimido, R., Lehman, L.-W.H., Szolovits, P., Celi, L., Weng, W.-H., (2018) Predicting Blood Pressure Response to Fluid Bolus Therapy Using Attention-Based Neural Networks for Clinical Interpretability; Nguyen, D.T., Sharma, S., Schulz, H., Asri, L.E., (2018) From FiLM to Video: Multi-Turn Question Answering with Multi-Modal Context; Jung, H., Han, M., Kang, M., Hwang, S., (2018) Learning What to Remember: Long-Term Episodic Memory Networks for Learning from Streaming Data; Vidya Prasad, K., Akarsh, S., Vinayakumar, R., Soman, K.P., (2019) A Deep Learning Approach for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects; Wehbe, B., Arriaga, O., Krell, M.M., Kirchner, F., (2018) Learning of Multi-Context Models for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; Zhong, G., Lin, X., Chen, K., (2018) Long Short-Term Attention; Bahdanau, D., Serdyuk, D., Brakel, P., Ke, N.R., Chorowski, J., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2016) Task Loss Estimation for Sequence Prediction; Xu, J., Zhang, Z., Friedman, T., Liang, Y., Van Den Broeck, G., (2018) A Semantic Loss Function for Deep Learning with Symbolic Knowledge; Welleck, S., Yao, Z., Gai, Y., Mao, J., Zhang, Z., Cho, K., (2017) Loss Functions for Multiset Prediction; Peters, M.E., Neumann, M., Iyyer, M., Gardner, M., Clark, C., Lee, K., Zettlemoyer, L., (2018) Deep Contextualized Word Representations; Howard, J., Ruder, S., (2018) Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for Text Classification; Joshi, S., Deshpande, D., (2018) Twitter Sentiment Analysis System; Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., Nakov, P., (2017) SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., (2006) SentiWordNet 3.0: An Enhanced Lexical Resource for Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining; Pérez, D., Crypto-influencers algorithm (2018) Url =, , https://github.com/dperezrada/crypto-influencers, lastaccessed on June 23, 2018; Nakamoto, S., (2018) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Rada, D.P., (2018) Personal Communication, , 01-22; Van Der Burgt, J., (2018) Making Sense of Bitcoin Price Levels",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English",Conference Paper,Scopus

Users' comments and tweets from twitter using Apache Flume and Price data was fetched from exchanges. Bitcoin first documented by allies Satoshi Nakamoto, the first decentralized currency payment system has gained a considerable attention in the financial system, economics, social media and computer science due to its combination of peer-to-peer nature, encryption technology, and monetary unit. Predicting the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a great challenge because it is immensely complex and dynamic in nature. In this paper, we have tried to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and used Twitter data to predict public mood. By combining both market sentiment and social sentiment because bitcoin price shows mixed properties. We also have selected some other important features from the blockchain information which has a major impact on Bitcoin's supply and demand and using them to train model that improves the predictive power of the future Bitcoin price. We have performed a deep study of how data from social media affect the price of Bitcoin and so we have included the twitter data in model training. Our model shows that how well LSTM predict the price of Bitcoin considering the high volatility. The precision given by our model is 60% and accuracy is 50%.

Consequently, many people are beginning to become more aware and accepting of the nature of digital currencies, and traders in particular seek to know how they can make profitable crypto-coin trades and investments. Although a number of research projects have been undertaken to develop systems that can effectively predict price movements in the cryptocurrency market, they display significant efficiency gaps, which this paper further explores. The authors then attempt to learn from past studies and construct a more holistic approach to a predictive price model for the cryptocurrency market. This focuses on assessing key factors that affect the volatility of the market - public perception, trading data, historic price data, and the interdependencies between Bitcoin and Altcoins - and how they can be best utilized from a technological aspect by applying sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, to increase the efficiency of the process. © 2018 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency Price Prediction; Machine Learning; Predictive Models; Sentiment Analysis",,"30 Bitcoin Hashtags Popular on Twitter | RiteTag: Find the Best Hashtags, , https://ritetag.com/best-hashtags-for/bitcoin, Accessed: 2017-12-20; D'Alfonso, A., Peter Langer, Z.V., The future of cryptocurrency (2016) International Security, 7 (5), pp. 7-45; Anantwar, S.G., Shelke, R.R., Simplified approach of ann: Strengths and weakness (2012) International Journal of Engineering and Innovative Technology (IJEIT), 1 (4), pp. 73-77; Byvatov, E., Comparison of support vector machine and artificial neural network systems for drug/nondrug classification (2003) Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling., 43 (6), pp. 1882-1889. , https://doi.org/10.1021/ci0341161; Ciaian, P., (2016) Virtual Relationships: Short-and Long-run Evidence from BitCoin and Altcoin Markets.; CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations, , https://coinmarketcap.com/, Accessed: 2017-07-22; Definitive Portal for Social Media Statistics Globally | Socialbakers, , https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/, Accessed: 2017-08-28; Ethereum-Explore-Google Trends, , https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Ethereum, Accessed: 2017-12-17; Greaves, A., Au, B., (2015) Using the Bitcoin Transaction Graph to Predict the Price of Bitcoin.; Joachims, T., Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features (1998) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)., 1398, pp. 137-142. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13928716, 1998; Kim, B.Y., Predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency transactions based on user comments and replies (2016) PLoS ONE., 11 (8), pp. 1-17. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161197; Pang, B., Lee, L., (2008) Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis; Patel, J., Predicting stock and stock price index movement using Trend Deterministic Data Preparation and machine learning techniques (2015) Expert Systems with Applications., 42 (1), pp. 259-268. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.040; Rowlands, J., (2014) Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading Bot, , April 2014; Statnikov, A., A comprehensive comparison of random forests and support vector machines for microarray-based cancer classification (2008) BMC Bioinformatics., 9 (1), p. 319. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-319; Yang, Y., Webb, G.I., (2001) Proportional K-Interval Discretization for Naive-Bayes Classifiers., pp. 564-575. , 2001",,"IEEE Computer Society","English",Conference Paper,Scopus

Among the other cryptocurrencies available in the market, Bitcoin cryptocurrency is the most valuable and famous currency. A large number of people discuss about the Bitcoin currency on the internet and social media platforms as well. These discussions help in determining the importance of Bitcoin in terms of users’ discussions about Bitcoin and can help in determining the value of Bitcoin in terms of people point of views about the topic. In this paper, sentiment analysis of the tweets of users on the topic of Bitcoin has been carried out. For this purpose, real-world twitter data set of Bitcoins is used. The data set has been divided into five separate sections for better comparative analysis, including overall extensive data analysis regarding tweets, retweets, tweets with mentions, tweets containing external links and also about the users who discuss regarding cryptocurrency of Bitcoin. A framework for sentiment analysis is proposed on the basis of Naïve Bayes sentiment classification algorithms which is widely used as a better option for text data. The proposed framework is capable to perform sentiment analysis of the tweets data. The results resemble that users’ opinions are on the high positive side about Bitcoins and people mostly people represent the positive sentiment about Bitcoins. The results are evaluated using the standard performance evaluation measures including precision, recall, f1- score and accuracy. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Bitcoin; Classification; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; Proposed framework; Sentiment analysis; Users’ opinions",,"Phillips, R.C., Gorse, D., Predicting cryptocurrency price bubbles using social media data and epidemic modelling (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI), pp. 1-7; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system; Conti, M.S.K.E., Lal, C., Ruj, S., A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Bitcoin (2018) IEEE Commun.

Because some researchers argued that the Bitcoin value is also determined by perception of users and investors, this paper examines how. Design/methodology/approach: The database of relative news articles as well as blog posts has been collected for the purpose of this research. Hence, each article has been given a sentiment score depending on the negative and positive words used in the article. Findings: This paper has identified that interaction between media sentiment and the Bitcoin price exists, and that there is a tendency for investors to overreact on news in a short period of time. Originality/value: While sentiment analysis of Twitter posts as a predictor of the Bitcoin price has been conducted in the past, this research does not have any analog because psycho-semantic dictionaries have not been applied earlier in the Bitcoin research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Lexicon-based sentiment analysis; Market efficiency","G055515N","Alstyne, M.V., Why bitcoin has value (2014) Communications of the ACM, 57 (5), pp. 30-32. , https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/5/174354-why-bitcoin-has-value/abstract; Brooke, J., (2009), A semantic approach to automated text sentiment analysis; Cambria, E., Schuller, B., Xia, Y., Havasi, C., New avenues in opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2013) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 28 (2), pp. 15-21; Engelberg, E.J., Parsons, A.C., (2011) The causal impact of media in financial markets, 66 (1), pp. 67-97; Garcia, D., Juan Tessone, C., Mavrodiev, P., Perony, N., (2014) The digital traces of bubbles: feedback cycles between socio-economic signals in the Bitcoin economy, , http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1408.1494G; Garcia, D., Schweitzer, F., (2015) Social signals and algorithmic trading of bitcoin, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01513, CoRR abs/1506.01513; Grayson, M.R., Kwak, M., Choi, A., Using time-series and sentiment analysis to detect the determinants of bitcoin prices (2014) Issues in Information Systems, 15 (2), pp. 350-358; Hayes, A., Cryptocurrency value formation: an empirical analysis leading to a cost of production model for valuing bitcoin (2016) Telematics and Informatics, , www.researchgate.net/publication/303094852_Cryptocurrency_Value_Formation_An_empirical_study_leading_to_a_cost_of_production_model_for_valuing_Bitcoin; Jobson, J.D., Korkie, B.M., Performance hypothesis testing with the Sharpe and Treynor measures (1981) The Journal of Finance, 36 (4), pp. 889-908. , www.jstor.org/stable/2327554; Jurek, A., Mulvenna, M.D., Bi, Y., Improved lexicon-based sentiment analysis for social media analytics (2015) Security Informatics, 4 (1), pp. 1-13. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13388-015-0024-x; Kaminski, J., Gloor, P.A., (2014) Nowcasting the bitcoin market with twitter signals, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7577, CoRR abs/1406.7577; Kaushik, C., Mishra, A., (2014) A scalable, lexicon based technique for sentiment analysis, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2265, CoRR abs/1410.2265; Kristoufek, L., (2013) Bitcoin meets google trends and wikipedia: Quantifying the relationship between phenomena of the internet era, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep03415, Scientific Reports 3, 3415 EP; Loughran, T., McDonald, B., When is a liability not a liability?

In particular, it has been possible to witness the online emergence of web 2.0 services that have been widely used as communication media. On one hand, services such as blogs, tweets, forums, chats, email have gained wide popularity. On the other hand, due to the huge amount of available information, searching has become dominant in the use of Internet. Millions of users daily interact with search engines, producing valuable sources of interesting data regarding several aspects of the world. Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency, represents a radical change in financial systems, attracting a large number of users and a lot of media attention. In this work we studied whether Bitcoin’s trading volume is related to the web search and social volumes about Bitcoin. We investigated whether public sentiment, expressed in large-scale collections of daily Twitter posts, can be used to predict the Bitcoin market too.

Sharing knowledge is an important part of learning and enhancing skills. Furthermore, emotions may affect decision-making and individual behavior. Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency system, represents a radical change in financial systems, attracting a large number of users and a lot of media attention. In this work, we investigated if the spread of the Bitcoin’s price is related to the volumes of tweets or Web Search media results. We compared trends of price with Google Trends data, volume of tweets and particularly with those that express a positive sentiment. We found significant cross correlation values, especially between Bitcoin price and Google Trends data, arguing our initial idea based on studies about trends in stock and goods market. © 2015 CEUR-WS.
